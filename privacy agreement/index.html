	<h1> Privacy Agreement </h1>

	<p> “Concusssed?” is an app that aids in concussion research at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. The app is intended for use by student athletes at a predetermined list of schools that exists in the app -> select school section. These schools have already been part of ongoing research into concussion testing. Concussed? administers the Flanker test which is a non-invasive method of gathering a sense of the user’s motor functionality.</p>
  	<h1> What Information We Take? </h1>
  	<p> We perform our research by working with the schools to assign random 5-digit codes to users at the selected schools. That is the only information we receive and with that information we compare scores on the test as the user continues to opt to take it. Users in our system appear only as 5-digit number sets for which we cannot determine age, name, gender, or any other piece of information which can be used to identify users. At the end of an administered test we receive the users selected school, identification number, the time the test was taken, the series of arrows that were shown on screen and the number of correct matches. </p>
  	<h1>Why Are We Doing This?</h1>
  	<p>We are in search of a way to reduce the amount of time it takes to determine if an athlete has received a concussion. The mobile phone is a powerful tool to accomplish this task. This app is intended to use the accelerometer and gyroscope to log responses from a user. Assuming a concussion has occurred, the users motor skills and decision-making speed has been found to have a measurable decrease. This app is an extension of our Android version.</p>
